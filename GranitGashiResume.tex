\section{Summary}

I am a future software engineer with broad interests across the stack. I have a particular fondness for learning new data structures, studying software design patterns and creating or working with performant algorithms. My further interests include Programming Languages, Natural Language Processing, Databases and many more, to help better myself in this future.

{\emph{Dynamic Programming} \\
Cash Solution using Dynamic Programing in Java; collaborated with a team of 2. I was Team leader and provided majority of the code for our final project for Data Structures and Algorithms class.}

\entry
{11/18 - 11/18}
{StudyWitUs, HackWitUs Hackathon}
{Wentworth Boston, Ma}
{\emph{Hackathon Web Application} \\
Created a website where a users can register and login; they could update their status to show what they are studying and where so other people may join them at their location. My team and I created this using BootStrap, Html, CSS, JavaScript, and some Jquery. Although Project was not finished entirely, it was good experience for my first Hackathon! }

\entry

{Organized our Own Hackathon, \href {http://hawkhack.io}{HawkHack.io}}
{Montclair, NJ}
{\emph{Computer Club} \\
Montclair State University has never hosted a hackathon before. The computer club at MSU which includes me, organized our first ever hackathon that had over 130 participants. We had quite a few sponsers including google, Monster, and even UPS. The whole process took us a couple of months to set up, although we were not certified by MLH, we still went through with the hackathon and it was a total success!}
